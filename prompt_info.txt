I am a theoretical particle physics PhD candidate at New Mexico State University, USA. I am currently engaged in research aimed at understanding the intrinsic motion of quarks and gluons inside the nucleons.

My PhD research under Dr. Michael Engelhardt (NMSU) focuses on lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of discretized space-time fields. In particular, I work on calculating Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions (TMDs) such as generalized Sivers shift, which represents the average transverse momentum of unpolarized quarks orthogonal to the transverse spin of the proton. I analyze the dependence of Sivers TMDs on the longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark by placing the Wilson gauge link in various off-axis directions on the lattice simulations. The analysis also utilizes PySR symbolic regression, a machine learning (ML) technique, to extract analytical functions from the lattice data.

I am also collaborating with Dr. Rajan Gupta and Dr. Tanmoy Bhattacharya from Los Alamos National Laboratory (T2) on a research project focused on lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations of the hadronic matrix elements needed to connect nucleon Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) to Standard Model (SM) and Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. This project is supported by a Travel Grant from the New Mexico Consortium at Los Alamos.

In parallel, I am collaborating with Dr. Chueng-Ryong Ji (North Carolina State University) on a research project that involves interpolating the manifestly covariant conformal group SO(4,2) between the instant form and the light-front form of relativistic dynamics. One of the main goals of this work is to study the conformal invariance of high-energy scattering processes in the aforementioned interpolating form dynamics. For a recent presentation on this topic, visit Dr. Ji’s NC State research group page.

As a driven and enthusiastic physicist with expertise in C++, Python, high-performance computing (HPC), symbolic regression, Monte Carlo simulations, and large-scale data analysis, I am fully committed to making significant contributions to scientific research and advancing our understanding of particle physics.

Working in particle physics, specifically in the Light Front framework, has long been a drive for me ever since I attended Prof.\@ Stanley Brodsky’s (one of the pioneers of Light Front Field Theory) one-week course in person. The weekly problem discussions with my advisor, the calculations, and the paper reviews strengthened my fundamentals and equipped me for graduate school. Considering my keenness in this field that I have been enriching along the way; I want to do my PhD in particle physics. Moreover, the NMSU Physics Graduate program is the best place for me because of the department's outstanding mentorship and effective research environment.\\

   During my high school, questions like why Newton's and Coulomb's laws follow the inverse square law, why abstract auxiliary variables like entropy play a vital role in physics, why an electron does not fall into the nucleus, and how to explain why $i^i$ takes a real value intuitively, had made me inspired in physics and math. I followed the Caltech Mechanical Universe, Walter Lewin's, and other standard courses to understand those problems and clarify my misconceptions. Several counter-intuitive concepts like the pendulum’s frequency does not depend on mass, the electric field inside the faraday cage is zero (later, I learned about the discontinuity of electric field over conducting surface) motivated me to pursue a major in physics. Furthermore, popular science books and physics documentaries such as The Cosmos and The Elegant Universe boosted my motivation.\\

  As I went on to do a bachelor's degree in physics, my curiosity gradually focused on particle physics and astrophysics after finding several ingenious concepts from Feynman's lectures and Susskind's Theoretical Minimum courses. Notably, I learned about abstract auxiliary variables other than entropy, such as lagrangian and electromagnetic four-potential, that have a hugely significant role in physics. Moreover, the 19th chapter of Feynman's lecture, Volume 2 (The Principle of Least Action), enlightened me by revealing the connection between action formulation and quantum mechanics. From Prof.\@ Kenneth Young’s lecture on action, I realized that action formalism lays the fundamental foundation for the whole of physics. From Landau-Lifshitz's Mechanics, I learned about Lagrangian's Arbitrariness, the freedom in Lagrangian to add a total time derivative to itself. The consequences of Lagrangian's arbitrariness in the Hamiltonian intrigued and excited me to learn further. Soon, I learned the relationship between gauge freedom and the arbitrariness of Lagrangian when I started studying Classical Electrodynamics. The electrodynamics problems that charmed me most at an undergraduate level were modifying Maxwell's equations for massive photons (Proca equation) and magnetic monopoles—since then, learning about Solitons has long been one of my objectives.\\ 

  During the summer of 2018, I got an opportunity to do a reading project at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics under Dr.\@ B.\@ Ravindra. As part of the project, I studied the photospheric and chromospheric features and coronal activities using Kodaikanal Solar Observatory data. Further, I learned about solar neutrinos and specifically about the neutrino problem. This project motivated my interest also in Theoretical Astrophysics. \\

  At the end of my bachelor’s degree, I got a chance to attend Prof.\@ Stanley Brodsky’s one-week course on ``Introduction to Light Front Hadron Physics" in person. Those excellent lectures delivered by Prof.\@ Stanley Brodsky and Prof.\@ Chueng Ji introduced me to the Quark Model, Fundamental Interactions, Light-Front Field Theory, and Quantum Chromodynamics. I got more enthusiastic about particle physics after several illuminating discussions with professors, postdocs, and PhD students I met there. This exposure prompted me to choose the light-front field theory as my research area. Presently, I am doing an MSc at NIT-Jalandhar; I specifically preferred this institute to further my experience and interest in Light front dynamics due to the research group's presence under Dr.\@ Harleen Dahiya (my current advisor).\\

  During the first year of my MSc, my interest in mathematical physics also gradually increased since I started learning group theory, complex analysis, and Green’s function. While learning QFT, the elegant way it automatically takes causality into account when we do the contour integration to solve the Green’s function for the Klein-Gordon operator has captivated me the most. Furthermore, I have been pondering the group structure of a set of all the arbitrarily possible Lagrangians for a system and that group’s properties. Last year, while learning classical field theory and covariant formulation, I tried to write a possible Lagrangian density that gives the modified Maxwell’s equations with a magnetic monopole. I had taken two sets of potentials (instead of 1 set) and made Lorentz invariance out of it to form Lagrangian density. Later, I found that my Magneto-electric Field tensor matches the Faraday tensor (Hodge dual). I am trying to understand the connections between those two sets of potentials. Problems like these motivate me. Also, I have been learning Analysis 1 and Abstract Group Theory to improve my mathematical preciseness and skills. To tackle any problem, I follow the bottom-up approach, comprehending one small question at a time and developing an understanding of the subject as I go along, investigating all possible related questions progressively. I like to visualize the problem via figures to deepen my perception, and consequently, I look for prospective solutions. I have been advancing myself through all my professors’ guidance and utilizing available facilities in my institute.
